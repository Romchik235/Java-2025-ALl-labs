THIS is a short instruction on HOW this PROGRAM WORKS. It has two modes: bad script and correct.
If we talk about the first option, it works by default even when there are some errors (without synchronization)
and the other second option works accordingly, performing tasks according to the option that was set.


First, a list of cars is shown so that you can interact with them and the parking lot.
By default, the Bad synchronization version is first and then the normal (stable) one.
But you can choose the bad one right away.
The user can interact with the parking lot or properly - everything is always great, and if something is entered incorrectly, then an error occurs due to the cycle and cases.
If briefly and concisely about how this program works, that's all.
The main thing at the beginning is that the user and the car are legalized so that you can register your car correctly.
There is also a list of cars.


In general, the program works correctly and you can also add something if necessary (say, improve its syntax and interaction) of course !
Thank you !
